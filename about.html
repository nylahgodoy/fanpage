                <p> Born on December 16, 1999 the Dolan Twins are a dynamic comedy duo featured on YouTube. The twins are Ethan & Grayson Dolan, both currently 18 years of age. They started out on vine, posting little clips and then went on to YouTube. Every Tuesday they post new videos and when they miss a Tuesday they often try to post twice the next week. At the age of 15 they moved from New Jersey to Los Angeles, California to further their YouTube career. Throughout their years since vine and even before, they've encountered hate  from various people trying to bring them down, but they've always had the love and suuprot from their fans to help cheer them up and make them laugh. They appriciated their fans so much that they decided to make a tour just for them named 4OU(4 Only You) in 2016. </p>
